# OOP
Learning Object Oriented Programming
### Lists are mostly used to represent simple pieces of information
### in this example we are defining a software engineer object 
### using a list that holds position, name, age, level and salary. 
### a list is not the ideal data structure to represent such a complex object, this is the reason why we have classes.
### classes represent complex objects, they contain functions that expalin the behaviour of our class. 
### basically a class is a blueprint how something should be defined
### instance attribute only belongs to a specific object created; in this case se and not the whole class
### class attribute is the same for every instance and can be  on the class itself
